# Gotchas & Surprises

> This file tracks unexpected behaviors, edge cases, and non-obvious insights. Things that made you go "Wait, what?"

## How to Add Gotchas

When you discover something surprising:
1. Document the surprise immediately
2. Explain why it's non-obvious
3. Include how to handle it
4. Auto-promote to patterns.md if it appears 3+ times
