# Successful Patterns

> This file tracks proven approaches that work. Each pattern should include context, implementation details, and why it works.

## How to Add Patterns

When you discover a successful approach:
1. Document it immediately (don't wait until end of session)
2. Include code examples when relevant
3. Link to related decisions/gotchas
4. Track usage count (increment when reused)
